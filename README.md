# ToDo List Using React Native
This is my first app built with a React Native frontend using Expo Go.

The backend is built with Express, Knex and Postgres.

## Running the app
- To run the backend, cd into server and run "npm run start"
- To run the frontend, cd into todo-app and run "yarn run ios"

## Notes
- iOS Simulator setup needed
- XCode setup needed
- Postgres docker container running with DATABASE for todo_rnative (or an alternative database config)
- Potential further setup may be needed
